# RTS-Modular-Unity-Project

For this project, I was tasked with creating a modular script framework for an RTS style game as if I were completing a job for a client.

I ended up creating a grid based system for movement and a turn based system for the player and enemy to move along the grid and attack one another. I intended to adjust the mechanics to be a time based turn system, but ran short on available work hours to do so.
